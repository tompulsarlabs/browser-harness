# Browser Harness ♞

Connect an LLM directly to your real browser through one editable CDP websocket. The agent writes missing helpers as it works, so the harness improves with every task.

Try browser-harness in [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com/v4?utm_campaign=browser-harness-use-in-cloud&utm_source=github) or paste the setup prompt into your coding agent.

```
  ● agent: wants to upload a file
  │
  ● agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py → helper missing
  │
  ● agent writes it                         agent_helpers.py
  │                                                       + custom helper
  ✓ file uploaded
```

**You will never use the browser again.**

## See it work

**Task:** "Open my X profile, find my latest 20 video posts, and download them."

[![Download my latest 20 X videos](docs/download-latest-20-x-videos.gif)](https://browser-use.com/showcase/videos/download-latest-20-x-videos.mp4)

## Setup prompt

Paste into Claude Code or Codex:

```text
Install or upgrade browser-harness to the latest stable version with uv using Python 3.12, register the skill from `browser-harness skill`, and connect it to my browser. Ask whether I want local browser recordings enabled; default to no and preserve my existing preference on upgrades. Follow https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness/blob/main/install.md if setup or connection fails.
```

The agent will open `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`. On first setup, tick
the checkbox so the agent can connect to your browser:

## How it works

- [`install.md`](install.md) connects the agent to your browser.
- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) teaches it the browser workflow.
- [`src/browser_harness/`](src/browser_harness/) stays protected while the agent writes reusable helpers in its local workspace.

## Experimental Safari adapter

This fork includes an optional [Safari adapter](adapters/safari/README.md) for
existing Safari tabs through macOS Apple Events. It uses a separate `safari-harness`
CLI and package, with familiar helper names. Safari does not implement Chrome CDP;
the existing `browser-harness` package and Chrome implementation are unchanged.

The adapter has controlled live coverage for reading, form entry, clicking, and
session reuse. Same-URL tab replacement and native navigation races remain open;
see its [verification record](adapters/safari/verification.md).

## Scale with Browser Use Cloud

Use your local browser for logged-in, personal work. When you want many browsers in parallel—with live previews, proxies, stealth, CAPTCHA solving, and more—scale with [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com/new-api-key).

## MCP server

`browser-harness-mcp` exposes the browser control helpers as MCP tools over
stdio, so any MCP client (Claude Code, Devin, Cursor, etc.) can drive the
browser without writing a second CDP layer. See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) for
setup and client configuration.

Bug fixes, documentation improvements, and agent-generated domain skills are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
